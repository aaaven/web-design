			<h2><a target="_blank" href = " http://designingfortheweb.co.uk/">Designing for the Web – free (online edition)</a>
			</h2>
			<p>Designing for the web is different than designing for any other medium. The breadth of skills required is sometimes daunting. The depth of experience required, seemingly unobtainable. Yet, the medium attracts designers from all spheres of design practice: from engineering and architecture, to product and graphic design. This chapter aims to provide a snapshot of the current state of the medium, and our role as practitioners working within it.</p>
